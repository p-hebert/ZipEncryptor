ZipEncryptor
============

Console-like java applet with command line file system navigation and a file picker.
Originally done with the intention to encrypt some sensitive files using a password and a file-based encryption method.
Since the executable is necessary to decrypt the file, and that the code would be easily reverse-engineerable,
the encryption part was dropped.
The program is fully functional except from the encryption class.

Feel free to use any part of this program however you may please. You do not need my consent beforehand, but I would like
you to at least say hello and inform me of your endeavours with my code!
